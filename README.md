Stock Data Scraper
This Python script allows you to scrape historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance for a given stock symbol. It utilizes the requests library to send HTTP requests to the Yahoo Finance website and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML content of the webpage. The scraped data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

requests

BeautifulSoup

pandas

Notes

Make sure to replace the URL variable with the URL of the Yahoo Finance page for the desired stock symbol.

The script retrieves data for the specified time period. You may need to adjust the URL parameters (period1 and period2) for different time periods.

The script assumes that the stock data is available on the Yahoo Finance page in a table format. If the structure of the webpage changes, the script may need to be updated accordingly.
